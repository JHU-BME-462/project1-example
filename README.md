# Project 1 Example
### Biomedical Engineering 580.462 Representations of Choice

This is an example experiment for project 1 implemented in Matlab with Psychtoolbox.

## Installation
### Requirements
- Matlab (tested on Mathlab 2017b).
- Psychtoolbox (tested on Psychtoolbox 3.0.14). Follow instructions for your system at the [PTB download page](http://psychtoolbox.org/download/)

### Download & Setup
Download the example project code or clone the repository.
You need to create a file called LOCAL_CONFIG.m that contains settings specific for your machine.
You may copy the file LOCAL_CONFIG.m.default to help with this, but make sure you make adjust the data path to a valid location on your computer, and if using multiple monitors the Screen pointer is used correctly.

## Running the experiment
Open Matlab and change working directory to the root of the project code folder. Execute expMain.m, type in a subject ID and complete the experiment.
